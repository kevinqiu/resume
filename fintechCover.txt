Hi, 

I'm a upcoming CS graduate from Vassar College and I'm looking for an entry level position in the NY metro area. My finance background consists of both personal and professional experiences. While in high school, like many, I turned to trading as a way to earn above minimum wage with little formal qualifications or work experience. While my dabbling in the foreign exchange futures market didn't make me a millionaire as I had hoped, it did teach me about financial instruments, markets, and trading. It also kindled an interest in finance that persists to the present, even though I have less time to follow markets and no longer actively trade. I've also worked at a fintech startup in the fixed income market called Konnect2. There I did development and QA/UX testing on their web app platform built on Scala Play.
